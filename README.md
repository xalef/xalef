ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Xavier Lefebvre, a soon-to-be Ph.D. graduate with Data Science experience. 

With a solid foundation in complex mathematical modeling, statistics, and machine learning, 
I have bring unique blend of analytical rigor and problem-solving prowess, 
ready to drive impactful insights and innovations.

Let's explore the possibilities of AI together! ðŸš€

# Data Science Portfolio
During my academic career I have led initiatives leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to drive strategic decision-making. My experience includes not just analysis, but also effectively communicating data-driven narratives to stakeholders across diverse domains. Furthermore, this work led to significant advancements in science and was published in reknowned peer-reviewed scientific journals. The link to these publications is provided in each repository. 

The Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics section showcases the main projects I have worked on during my academic career, in the form of Jupyter notebooks. 
The Deep learning section presents data science projects completed for self learning, and hobby purposes.

## Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics
