# Data Science Portfolio
During my academic career I have led initiatives leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to drive strategic decision-making. My experience includes not just analysis, but also effectively communicating data-driven narratives to stakeholders across diverse domains. Furthermore, this work led to significant advancements in science and was published in reknowned peer-reviewed scientific journals. The link to these publications is provided in each repository. 

The Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics section showcases the main projects I have worked on during my academic career, in the form of Jupyter notebooks. The Deep learning section presents data science tools that were used during my Ph.D. For this section, all the projects are within the same repository.
